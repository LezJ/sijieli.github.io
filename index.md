## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student (starting Dec. 2023) at Computer Vision Research Group of The University of Sheffield (TUoS). I am fortunate enough to have Prof. Jungong Han and Dr. Chen Chen as my advisors. Previous to my PhD study, I obtained my bachelor's degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) and my master's degree from University of Edinburgh (UoE), respectively. I have also served as a Machine Learning Engineer in industry for nearly three year.

## Research Interests

- **Computer vision**
- **Multimodal learning:** Multimodal foundation models & applications, efficiency, robustness, etc.

*I am currently open to all kinds of collaboration in the scope of multimodal learning and computer vision. <br>

## Ongoing Research

### 1. Learning with Missing Modalities *(in submission)*  
[Project page](https://lezj.github.io/SimMLM_project_page/)

### 2. Visual Token Compression in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)  
Multimodal large language models often suffer from inefficiency due to the high number of visual tokens required for image/video inputs (e.g. 576 visual token per image for LLaVA-1.5). The ongoing research explores efficient token compression techniques by identifying and pruning redundant or uninformative visual tokens, aiming to reduce computational overhead while preserving performance.
