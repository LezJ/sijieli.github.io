## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student (starting Dec. 2023) at Computer Vision Research Group of The University of Sheffield (TUoS). I am fortunate enough to have Prof. Jungong Han and Dr. Chen Chen as my advisors. Previous to my PhD study, I obtained my bachelor's degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) and my master's degree from University of Edinburgh (UoE), respectively. I have also served as a Machine Learning Engineer in industry for nearly three year.


## Research Interests

- **Computer vision**
- **Multimodal learning:** foundation models & applications, learning under extreme conditions (e.g. missing modalities).

*I am currently open to all kinds of collaboration in the scope of multimodal learning and computer vision. <br>
