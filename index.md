## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student (starting Dec. 2023) at Computer Vision Research Group of University of Sheffield, advised by Prof. [Jungong Han](https://https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=hNi1gxAAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. [Chen Chen](https://cherise215.github.io/). Previous to my PhD study, I obtained my bachelor's degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) and my master's degree from University of Edinburgh (UoE), respectively. I have also served as a Machine Learning Engineer in industry for nearly three year.
